## What is it

Signal is a script that collects specific page performance events and sends them to a configurable service url.

## Installation

At the moment Signal is distributed as a _script_. Meaning you have to build your own version and embed it in your web page. In order to build your version of it, follow these steps:

Clone the repo using SSH

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sumup-oss/signal.git
```

Or using https

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumup-oss/signal.git
```

Run

```bash
yarn
```

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file contains the following values:

```bash
SERVICE_URL="" # (Required) The endpoint where events will be send to
APPLICATION_NAME="" # (Optional) the application identier. This is useful when you have more than one application sending events
```

Now you are ready to build the script. If you want to customize the events, please refer to [Customization](#customization).

In order to generate the script, run

```bash
yarn build
```

Copy the output from `build/perf.js`

```bash
pbcopy < build/perf.js
```

Add the script to the `<head>` tag of your html file. This is required due to how you [collect the time-to-interactive](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/user-centric-performance-metrics#tracking_tti) metric.

## Events

The events are provided by both the [PerformanceObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver) and [PerformanceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming) APIs.

### Via PerformanceObserver ([paint entry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformancePaintTiming))

- first-paint
- first-contentful-paint

### Via PerformanceObserver ([longtask entry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming))

- time-to-interactive

### Via PerformanceTiming

- dom-interactive
- dom-content-loaded
- dom-loading
- dom-complete

Keep in mind each API has a different browser support. Please refer to [Browser compatibility](#browser-compatibility) section for more info on it.

### Event dispatch

All events are transported using the [Navigator.sendBeacon api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon).

The events from the PerformanceObserver API (first-paint, first-contentful-paint and time-to-interactive) are dispatched _individually_ and as soon as they are available, to avoid losing the data.

The events from the PerformanceTiming API (dom-interactive, dom-content-loaded, dom-loading, dom-complete) are batched into a single request and are dispatched after the `onload` event. This is due since we have to wait for some properties after the `onload` event anyways.

### Event enhancing

By default each event is enhanced with the following metadata:

```js
{
  event_name,
    user_agent,
    google_analytics_client_id,
    connection_type,
    effective_connection_type,
    url,
    timestamp,
    application;
}
```

Please refer to [Customization](#customization) for more information on how to add/remove properties and events

## Customization

You can customize both Events and Metadata fields.

### Customizing Events

You can edit both `PerformanceObserver` and `PerformanceTiming` handlers. All you have to do is edit the [perf.ts](src/perf.ts) file.

### Customizing Metadata fields

You'll have to edit two files:

- [The Event type definition](src/types.d.ts) `IEnhancedMetric`
- [The event enhancement function](src/event.ts) `enhance`

## Browser compatibility

The script is powered by three APIs:

- [Navigator.sendBeacon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon)
- [PerformanceObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver)
- [PerformanceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming)

If `sendBeacon` isn't available, the script won't be executed. There isn't a fallback with XHR due to the blocking nature of it.

Since each type of event has a different browser support, please refer to the table to understand which events you can support:

| Event                  |                                          Browser                                          |
