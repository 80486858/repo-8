`scala` can be installed either manually, or using OS-specific packages.
OS-specific packages are experimental and in-progress.
Manual installation is recommended for now.

## Manual installation

### Linux

Download the launcher from GitHub release assets with
```text
$ sudo curl -fLo /usr/local/bin/scala https://github.com/VirtuslabRnD/scala-cli/releases/download/latest/scala-x86_64-pc-linux.gz
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scala
```

Check that it runs fine by running its `about` command:
```text
$ scala about
```

### macOS

Download the launcher from GitHub release assets with
```text
$ sudo curl -fLo /usr/local/bin/scala https://github.com/VirtuslabRnD/scala-cli/releases/download/latest/scala-x86_64-apple-darwin.gz
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scala
```

Check that it runs fine by running its `about` command:
```text
$ scala about
```

### Windows

Download the launcher from GitHub release assets with
```text
> curl -fLo scala.zip https://github.com/VirtuslabRnD/scala-cli/releases/download/latest/scala-x86_64-pc-win32.zip
> tar -xf scala.zip
```

Check that it runs fine by running its `about` command:
```text
> scala about
```

Note that this doesn't put the `scala` command in the `PATH`. For that, you can create a directory, move the
launcher there, and add the directory to the `PATH` with
```text
> md "%USERPROFILE%/scala-cli"
> scala add-path "%USERPROFILE%/scala-cli"
> move scala.exe "%USERPROFILE%/scala-cli"
```
