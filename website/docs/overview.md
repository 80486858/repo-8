The `scala-cli` CLI aims at making it easier to run, test, and package, Scala sources.

It can:
- [compile](./commands/compile.md) Scala code,
- [run](./commands/run.md) it,
- [package](./commands/package.md) it as a JAR or in formats such as deb, rpm, MSI, â€¦,
- fire up a [REPL](./commands/repl.md) allowing you to quickly play with the code,
- compile and run [tests](./commands/test.md) suites,

... and many other things.

Scala CLI supports most recent Scala versions (`3.x`, `2.13.x` and `2.12.x`) and changing the Scala version as easy as providing `--scala` parameter (more in [the cookbook](./cookbooks/scala-versions.md)). 

Scala CLI supports as well compiling and running Scala to JVM (by default), [Scala.js](./guides/scala-js.md) and [Scala Native](./guides/scala-native.md).

Scala-cli documentation is split into 3 main section:
 - [Commands](./commands/basics.md) where you learn how to use most important commands that Scala CLI offers
 - [Guides](./guides/intro.md) where you can read about core aspects of Scala CLI and learn how Scala CLI interacts with other tools like IDE
 - Scala CLI [Cookbook](./cookbooks/intro.md) where you can learn how to solve particular problems with Scala CLI

**Happy hackking with Scala CLI!**
