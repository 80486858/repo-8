The `scala` CLI aims at making it easier to run, test, and package, Scala sources.

It can:
- compile Scala code,
- run it,
- package it as a JAR or in formats such as deb, rpm, MSI, â€¦,
- fire up a REPL allowing you to manually run your code,
- compile and run tests suites,

and many other things.

It supports all major Scala versions, including both Scala 2 and Scala 3 versions.

It consists in a native executable, generated by [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org)
native image. It runs fine on Linux and macOS with no prior requirements, and
only requires the [Visual C++ Redistributable Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
on Windows.

It automatically downloads and unpacks a JVM if none is installed on your system, so that
all its commands work fine even if a JVM isn't already installed. The `scala` CLI
uses [Bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/) under-the-hood to compile Scala code.
It takes care of fetching and starting Bloop if needed, so that you don't have to worry
about it.

It supports all 3 major Scala platforms:
- JVM
- Scala.JS
- Scala Native

but requires Node to be installed for Scala.JS to work fine, and the
[Scala Native requirements](https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/setup.html#installing-clang-and-runtime-dependencies) for Scala Native.

The next pages help you install the Scala CLI, and walk you through many of its features. Head on
