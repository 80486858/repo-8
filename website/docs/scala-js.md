- requires `node`

- no linker such as webpack for now: we only generate a `.js` file corresponding to the `.scala`
sources, run it with node / npm yourself

- enable it either on the command-line, or in conf file

- beware platform dependencies

- options?

- `run` / `test` / `package` should all work
