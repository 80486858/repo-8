Scala Native only works with Scala `2.13.x` and `2.12.x` however we recommend using `2.13.x`.

- requires LLVM toolchain, see requirements on Scala Native website

- enable via the command-line using `--native`

- beware platform dependencies

- `compile` / `run` / `test` / `package` should all work
